  - Repository name, description, and purpose
  - Full architecture overview (frontend, backend, API design, data flow)
  - Complete tech stack with versions where available
  - Existing code patterns and conventions the developer must follow

  ## 2. REPOSITORY STRUCTURE
  - Directory layout and file organization
  - Key files and their responsibilities
  - Module boundaries and dependencies

  ## 3. TASK BREAKDOWN (Most Important Section)
  For EACH user story, create an elaborate implementation task that includes:
  - **What to build**: Detailed functional description
  - **Where to implement**: Exact files to create or modify, with file paths
  - **How to implement**: Step-by-step implementation approach
  - **Data models**: Any new or modified data structures/schemas needed
  - **API endpoints**: New routes, request/response schemas, HTTP methods
  - **UI components**: Frontend components to create or modify
  - **Business logic**: Core logic, validation rules, edge cases to handle
  - **Integration points**: How this connects to existing code
  - **Acceptance criteria**: Specific conditions that must be met

  ## 4. TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS
  - Code style and naming conventions from the existing codebase
  - Framework-specific patterns to follow
  - Error handling approach
  - Security considerations

  ## 5. TESTING REQUIREMENTS
  - Unit tests needed
  - Integration test scenarios
  - Edge cases to test

  ## 6. DATABASE CHANGES (if applicable)
  - New tables/columns needed
  - Migration scripts
  - Relationships and constraints

  Make the prompt comprehensive enough that a developer can implement each story without needing additional context. Be specific about file paths, function names, and code patterns from the existing codebase.

  ---

  # CODEBASE CONTEXT

  {context_sections}
