Type: Bug
Summary: Pay roll validation bug
Description: ## Bug Description: Payroll Validation Error

Overview/Background:

A bug has been identified in the payroll validation process. This impacts the accuracy of employee payments and could lead to compliance issues. The payroll processing workflow involves several critical steps, including collecting employee timesheets, calculating gross pay, deducting taxes and contributions, generating payslips, and transferring salaries to bank accounts. This bug occurs during the validation stage after gross pay calculation and before payslip generation.

Steps to Reproduce:

Navigate to the Payroll Processing Module.

Select the "Process Payroll" option for the current pay period.

Input timesheet data for an employee with overtime hours exceeding [Specify Overtime Threshold, e.g., 40 hours].

Initiate the payroll calculation process.

Review the calculated gross pay and deductions.

Observe that the system incorrectly calculates [Specify the incorrect calculation, e.g., overtime pay, tax deductions, or contribution amounts] for the affected employee.

Proceed to generate payslips.

The generated payslip reflects the incorrect calculations.


Expected Result:

The system should accurately calculate gross pay, including overtime pay, and correctly deduct taxes and contributions based on the employee's timesheet data and applicable regulations. The generated payslip should reflect these accurate calculations.

Actual Result:

The system incorrectly calculates [Specify the incorrect calculation, e.g., overtime pay, tax deductions, or contribution amounts], leading to inaccurate payslips and potential payment errors.

Technical Notes:

The payroll processing workflow relies on accurate data input and adherence to predefined calculation rules. The bug may stem from:

* An error in the formula used to calculate [Specify the incorrect calculation, e.g., overtime pay, tax deductions, or contribution amounts].
* Incorrect configuration of tax or contribution rates.
* A data validation issue preventing the system from correctly processing overtime hours.

Dependencies/Related Items:

* This bug is dependent on the accurate input of employee timesheet data.
* Related to the Tax Calculation Module.
* Related to the Employee Profile Management Module (for accurate tax and contribution information).
